This account is used solely to contribute to other FOSS hosted here.

Active development on personal projects has moved to a self-hosted Gitea instance at: https://git.based.zone.

Projects hosted here on GH will soon only contain links to my hosted repo.

CI/CD will move from GitHub Actions to a Concourse instance once setup.

I will keep this account for contributions to FOSS projects hosted here, but my personal projects will not continue here.

This move was influenced by a number of factors, but GitHub/Microsoft's use of hosted code to train AI is among them.
